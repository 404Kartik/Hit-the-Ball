This project is a game created purely using Web-elements
I have used the Paper.js library for vector graphic sripting.

The Ball goes to random positions starting from a higher number going to a lower number
If you hit it early you get the higher point.

Use arrow keys to move
and Space bar to shoot

Happy Playing
