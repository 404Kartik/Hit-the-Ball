# Hit the Ball
Hit the ball is a web based game where in you have to shoot the randomly generated number.
## Technologies used to build
The following technologies were used to make this web game possible
**paper.js**
**howler.js**
**javascript**
**html**
**css**
## How the game works?
- **Step 1** The script randomly generates a number smaller than 1,000
- **Step 2** The number is placed anywhere on the _canvas_ over the HTML
- **Step 3** - The player has to use arrow keys to move the shooter and the spacebar to shoot the randomly generated, randomly placed number
- **Step 4** - The number starts to move to another randomly generated position and starts to decrease as well
## Concept
The player has to hit the rand number as soon as possible to gain more points.
The more the delay the player does to hit the number with the shooter he will recieve lesser points.

The goal is to hit it super fast to gain most points.
